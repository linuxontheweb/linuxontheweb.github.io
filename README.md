Linux used to be fun because expectations were low and possibilities were high. 
The online communities that gathered around it were truly pleasurable to be a part of.
I hope to bring those same feelings back in the context of web development.

Although this project includes a desktop environment, it is not primarily
about that.  It is mainly about the idea that modern browsers now offer a
programmatically accessible file system that exists within domain-specific
"sandboxes."

## Local deployment

Locally deploying LOTW is as simple as simple can be. All you need to do is run
a web server in the root of the project directory. On Linux, this command
should suffice for most people:

	python3 -m http.server

You should then be able to visit the site at http://localhost:8000.
You can optionally specify a custom port number like so:

	python3 -m http.server 12345

The site should then be live at http://localhost:12345.

## Viewing and editing source files

vim is the recommended text editor, mainly because of the ability to enable row
folding via the manual insertion of markers.  Since the files in this
repository can be quite large, row folding is an essential feature of the
development side of LOTW. The instructions below are specific to vim's runtime
configuration file, .vimrc.

### Enabling row folding

To browse the source code as intended, the following lines must be included in
your .vimrc:

	set foldmethod=marker
	set foldmarker=«,»
	set foldlevelstart=0

To quickly toggle between opened and closed row folds with the Enter key, add this line:

	nmap <enter> za

### Inserting fold markers

These instructions will enable the easy insertion of fold markers into your
code (from both normal and insert mode).

To insert an open fold marker, invoked with Alt+o, add these lines:

	execute "set <M-o>=\eo"
	nnoremap <M-o> a//«<esc>
	inoremap <M-o> //«

To insert a close fold marker, invoked with Alt+c, add these lines:

	execute "set <M-c>=\ec"
	nnoremap <M-c> a//»<esc>
	inoremap <M-c> //»

To insert both an open and close fold marker, with a space in between,
invoked with Alt+f, add these lines:

	execute "set <M-f>=\ef"
	nnoremap <M-f> a//«<enter><enter>//»<esc>
	inoremap <M-f> //«<enter><enter>//»
