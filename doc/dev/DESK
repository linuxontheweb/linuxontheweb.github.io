/*THIS IS ALL VERY SHITTY, SO JUST SPEND TIME THINKING ABOUT IT AND GETTING IT«
REASONABLY DEBUGGED, THEN DON'T FUCKING WORRY ABOUT THIS SHITTY ADVANCED FEATURE.

Very, very stupid hacks because of the idea of using vim to edit local
javascript files that are used for local app developement. There is a hotkey in
vim for reloading the app windows that are under development. First of all, vim
"owns" the app window by putting a "owned_by" member on it, so the window
cannot be closed (via mouse or desktop shortcut) or reloaded via the desktop's
Alt+r shortcut. Also, the window now has a reload method on it, which is passed
a callback (from vim.js @FJUSOP) that is called back with the new window object
(so that vim can have a handle to the new one, since the old one is lost). When
vim exits cleanly, it deletes the "owned_by" member, so that the window can
once more be independently closed/reloaded. The app window needs to be raised
to the top of the stack (as CWIN) in order to be reloaded, and then vim's terminal
window needs to be raised right after reloading.

How about an owned_by property?

/*The concept of local application development://«

1) We save to the local fs.
	a) Create a url via URL.createObjectURL (portable), using the text of the file
	b) Create a filesystem:// URL (Chrome only? Would Edge even allow this?)

/*Here's the situation: Whenever the icon cursor moves away from an icon«
on the desktop, the icon's label should hide the overflow of the name, so that only
one line is showing. Usually, the Window.on method will take care of this @VKUIOKL
(i.e. when cycling through the window stack). But when we are opening a window, the
newly created window is already occluding the desktop by the time this is called. So,
we added in the test @FRUTIOP in open_file_by_path, for whenever the path refers
to a folder window.

/*@HFYUIOTS: Don't understand why app.onfocus was called by desk_menu.kill_cb. That
messes up menu functions that call popups which call window.on, which calls app.onfocus.
*/
/*Maybe change certain desktop keydown functions from, e.g. m_ to the keypress "m", so
that toggling windows doesn't mean that the m press event gets sent to a window (like
the Terminal).
*/
/*3 simple changes to enable a (hopefully) seamless icon accounting experience«
(but it really currently only seems to apply to literally mv'ing icons between
desktop/folders). The idea is that there can be an arbitrary number of icons
for each node. These changes allows us to remove all icons from the display
(except for the one that is being handled by the mouse and controlled by the
gui) whenever an underlying node's location (parent directory) is being
changed. This means that we can "talk" directly to each icon's DOM elements
rather than, e.g. needing to search around for the parent folder windows and 
querying them for the icon with the given name.

1) In fs.js, added a .icons property to the Node constructor that points to an 
	empty array.
2) @CNJPLMYTY (at the end of the Icon constructor): We did node.icons.push(this)
3) @WMKFTYIOP1 (in move_icon_by_path)://«
	if (frompath !== topath){
		while (node.icons.length) node.icons.pop().del();
	}//»
4) But 3 was WRONG because it failed to allow for the graceful removal of those//«
icons that are being actively manipulated by the mouse user, causing them to
disappear from the interface while the animation moves them to their
destination folder. So, in fs.js, just before the move_icon_by_path function is
called (@MDEROPI), we do this:

	if (if_cp) {
		gotfrom = null;
	}
	else if (gotfrom !== gotto){
		let icons = fent.icons;
		while (icons.length) {
			let icn = icons.pop();
			if (icn === fromicon) {
				continue;
			}
			icn.del();
		}
	}

... where fent is just a dumb name for the node, and fromicon is whatever icon
is being manipulated in the gui.

So hopefully all relevant icons are being accounted for, and those
icons that are no longer relevant are being gracefully removed.
//»
5) But 4 was wrong because gotfrom and gotto included icons that were just
being renamed, so now have: @WMKFTYIOP2, just after all the non-moving icons
have been renamed...

...but what about the case in which the icons don't have permission to be moved
to wherever the user is trying to move them to?

/*10/31/24« 

@SJNMYEJK we create a "fake" icon (in open_file_by_path), in order to feed into
open_icon_app (@WKIUTHJU), if it has a ".app" extension. The 'open' command
does it this way. Now I want vim to be able to call open_icon_app with a fake
icon that includes an object URL, created by URL.createObjectURL. After it does
this, it will have a handle on the given Window object, and should be able to
call reload on it with a new object URL. IMPORTANT: I WANT TO USE LOTW VIM TO
DEVELOP A SHELL COMMAND LANGUAGE PARSING ENGINE.

let fake = {
	winargs: opt.WINARGS,
	name: fname,
	path: (patharr.join("/")).regpath(true),
	fullpath: () => {
		return fullpath;
	}
};

But really, we just need to call open_app:

open_app(appname, {
	winArgs: icn.winargs,
	appArgs: obj.args,
	icon: icn,
	fsUrl: fsUrl(`/blobs/${node.blobId}`),
	winCb: win_cb
});

But instead of giving it an fsUrl, we want to give it a dataUrl, to work with
purely in-memory strings of text.

But *first*, the api.openApp interface needs to only take an opts object as
the second arg. This is also defined as Desk.open_app.

Need to make sure NOONE is calling Desk.open_app.

Now we can call api.openApp(appname,{force, winArgs, appArgs, dataUrl: ...}).

Let's get rid of the entire "fs_url/fsUrl" concept as a way to open an
application window. Instead, we can do the same thing with a dataUrl concept.
Then, it is just a matter of *where* we are getting the original Javascript
text string.  It can be either from somewhere in the filesystem or from the
lines of a text editor (or for that matter, from some other application's
in-memory data structures). Either way, we are doing URL.createObjectURL with
a new Blob([string_of_js_here]);

In vim, there is a reload_win arg. Just need to clean up all of the old/crusty 
mechanisms related to applications/windows/reloading...

So once I get this stuff working, I can develop the shell parser in it...
