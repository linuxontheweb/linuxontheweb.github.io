9/18/2024: The entire development environment has been moved from a "chroot
jail" in ChromeOS developer mode (aka crouton) into a non-standard subfolder of
/usr/local within the underlying Linux system (gentoo). This is
/usr/local/home, and the project root is /usr/local/home/lotw.  In the "home
directory," there are symlinks to certain files that are under constant
development. This "home directory" is not recognized by the underlying system
as such, and so configuration files like .bashrc and .vimrc go into the
official home directory at /home/chronos/user.

The package manager is Chromebrew (command lines like "crew install vim" should
get things working fairly nicely).
